In this project you will create a program that computes how far away, in feet, a listener is from a lightning strike. Sound travels approximately 1,100 feet per second through air. Thus knowing the interval between the time you see a lightning bolt and the time the sound reaches you enables you to compute the distance to the lightning. For this project, assume that the time interval is 7.2 second.
